#API intro

- What is, conceptually, an api.
- How API's and HTTP protocol and request work.
- HTTP request and JSON

2 types of request in HTTP( GET REQUEST, POST REQUEST) GETS which hold the url+path+arguemnt
and POST will hold the json files that contain dictionaries that are assigned to values, which allow the arguemnts to be specfied.

API's are a way for computers to talk to each other and are mostly formatted in json.
